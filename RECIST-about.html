    <h1>About the SAbR RECIST Calculator</h1>
    <p> Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) is a radiation treatment used as an alternative to
        traditional radiation. With SAbR, radiation is used in small, concentrated beams that give intense dosage to a
        tumor but greatly reduce the amount of radiation experienced by the surrounding, healthy cells. It is used as an
        alternative to
        surgery,
        so this leads to fewer hospital visits for patients.
        <br></br>
        Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) is a standard, universalized way to determine how well a
        cancer patient is responding to treatment. This is usually done by repeated measurements of the longest diameter
        in target lesions, and results are displayed in percent changes between initial values and values found after
        treatment and either a Complete Response, Partial Response, Progressive Disease, or Stable Disease.
        <br></br>
        This calculator is not a substitute for clinical trials and judgements. We make no claims about the accuracy of
        the information calculated.

        This calculator was created by Naveed Ansari under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Wentland (MD, PhD) and Dr.
        Jamal Gardezi (PhD) in the Department of Radiology, University of Wisconsin - Madison.
